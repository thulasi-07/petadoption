            <p>"Pet adoption is the process of transferring responsibility for a pet that was previously owned by
                another party. Common sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters, rescue groups, or other pet
                owners.<br>
                Some organizations give adopters ownership of the pet, while others use a guardianship model wherein the
                organization retains some control over the animal's future use or care."</p>
